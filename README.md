## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jk08y/secure-share.git
cd secure-share
```

2. Create a MySQL database and update the configuration in `config.php`:
```php
const DB_CONFIG = [
    'host' => 'localhost',
    'name' => 'your_database_name',
    'user' => 'your_database_user',
    'pass' => 'your_database_password'
];
```

3. Set up the uploads directory and permissions:
```bash
mkdir uploads
chmod 755 uploads
```

4. Configure your web server to point to the project directory.

5. Access the application through your web browser.

## Security Configuration

1. Ensure your `uploads` directory is properly secured:
```bash
# Set proper ownership
chown www-data:www-data uploads

# Set secure permissions (755 is recommended over 777 for better security)
chmod 755 uploads
```

2. Configure maximum upload size in both PHP and application settings:
   - Update `php.ini`: `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size`
   - Adjust `max_file_size` in `config.php`

3. Update your webserver configuration to prevent direct access to the uploads directory.

## Usage

1. Upload a file by dragging and dropping or clicking the upload area
2. Select an expiration time (24 hours, 7 days, or 30 days)
3. Get a secure sharing link
4. Share the link with your recipient

## Configuration Options

Edit `config.php` to customize:
- Maximum file size
- Allowed file extensions
- Upload directory path
- Database settings
- Expiration options
- Base URL  

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Security Considerations

- Files are automatically deleted upon expiration
- Download links are randomly generated and secured
- File extensions are validated
- Maximum file size is enforced
- Database queries are prepared to prevent SQL injection
